PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Let us consider a situation where a database is shared between many users.Â Some users are readers, while some are writers. If one of the writers tries editing the database, no other reader or writer should be accessing the database, otherwise, changes will not be visible to him/her.

SOLUTION:
In the case of the traditional Readers-Writers Problem, we use mutex and wrt semaphores. The mutex semaphore updates the readcount variable, which denotes the number of readers currently reading the database. Only the first reader has to acquire the wrt mutex to enter the critical section whereas all writers have to access it. The last reader signals the wrt semaphore after completing the reading. Therefore, it creates a situation where writers starve indefinitely when infinite readers queue up to get into the critical section. In the case of the Starve-Free Readers-Writers Problem, we introduce a new semaphore named enter. All readers and writers have to acquire this semaphore before entering in the critical region with equal priority. Thus, if a writer arrives between two readers, the writer will get a fair chance to acquire the enter mutex and the critical region, provided no reader is busy there. Thus, in this case, neither readers nor writers starve.
